# These Days in Travel in Seattle, as 19yo JP man.

## In the way
I leaved from Japan at July 29. It's my birthday. So I became 19yo just before boarding an airplane.
It took about 10 hours to arrive at Dubai. It was very very long. I slept for almost all time while I'm on an airplane.
When I arrived at Dubai International Airport, it was 4AM, so I bought some bottles of water and just wait. Then I posted a question about Seattle on Reddit. I asked advices about Seattle, I got some information.
After that, I boarded an airplane bound for an Airport at Seattle.

## Arrived!!
After 14 hours on the airplane, I finally arrived! After picking up a baggage at lane, I passed the immigration check. It was 1:30PM, so I sought to go to hotel. But, I struggled a lot to just do such thing. I walked around airports for about 30 minutes, but I couldn't find the station to ride on a metro I wanted.
